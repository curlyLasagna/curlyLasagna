### Hi there 👋

I'm Luis. I love exploring different open source projects and figuring out ways I can incorporate it to side projects or my life.

My love of open source started with my usage of GNU/Linux.

I'm currently using Arch Linux<img src='https://i.redd.it/2bpa3biaa3r71.png' width=70> as my daily driver.

Currently learning Nix to manage packages and creating deterministic and reproducible development environments.
